# ChromaVision ( Equithon 2018 Project )
A web app for the colour blind paired with an existing chrome extension to make it more useful.

There are many chrome extensions available on the chrome web store which can alter the colours of your webpage but the web app takes it to the next level by telling you the exact shade of colour you are looking at so that you can alter the colours according to your needs and test the web extension if it is working correctly or not.

I used simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make the web app.
